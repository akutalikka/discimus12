<h1>Discimus: <br /> 
We study </h1>

<p>
On this site (Discimus) you can study and practise school subjects and other things in different languages. There are always two languages side by side. On the preliminary site we have content in Finnish, Swedish, English and Persian.

</p>

<p>
This is just a small demo version, an initial idea on what this project Discimus might look like. Only a few mini lessons on mathematics, physics, and history are currently on display. Technically the site is rather clumsy. 

</p>


<p>
Hopefully soon we can develop the site in many ways. One goal is to produce a wiki-style simple site for primary school students who need to study in a foreign language: you could study the same content in your own language and in the new language.  Learning material will be produced, if possible, also in audio and video format.
