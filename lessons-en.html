<h1>Grammar terms </h1>

<h2>Word classes: adjectives, nouns, verbs, and pronouns</h2>
<p>Words can be divided into classes such as adjectives, prepositions, 
interjections, nouns, verbs, adverbs and numerals, and others. 
Here we only examine a few of them in a simple way.</p>


<h3>Adjectives</h3>
Adjectives tell us how things are like. Examples: <br />
good  <br />
bad <br />
strong <br />
yellow <br />
ideal <br />
round <br />
applicable <br />
spicier  <br />
the dullest <br />
democratic 

</p> 

<h3>Nouns</h3>
<p> Nouns are the names of things. Examples:  <br />
chair, table, pencil, paper <br />
strength idea, <br />
usefulness, goodness, application <br />
democracy, republic, king, kingdom 

</p>

<h3>Verbs</h3>

<p>

Verbs are related to doing and being. Examples:  <br />
walk, run, stay, <br />
move, write, read, listen <br />
idealize, make, prove, lie, apply
</p>

<h3>Pronouns</h3>
<p> Pronouns are used instead of the nouns. Examples: <br />
I, you, he, she<br />
We, you, they, <br />
this, that, it <br />
these, those, they
</p>


<h2>Subject, object and predicate</h2>
<p>
Parsing sentences means finding the parts of a sentence, or the roles of words in a sentence. 
Subject is the doer. 
Object is the thing that the subject does something to. 
Predicate is the verb. 
Different languages have different rules how to operate with these roles (subject, object, predicate). 
There are many more roles to be studied later.
</p>


<p>Example 1</p>

<p>The boy kicked the ball.<br />
 Begin by identifying the subject (noun phrase) and predicate (verb phrase). <br />
 The boy is the subject. <br />
 "kicked" is the predicate. <br />
 "the ball" is the object.
</p>

<p>Examples 2</p>
<p>I love you.<br />
You love me. </p>

<p> In the first sentence, 
"love" is the predicate. The pronoun "I" is the subject and "you" in the end is the object.
</p>

<p> In the second sentence, 
"love" is the predicate. The pronoun "You" is the subject and "me" in the end is the object.
</p>

<p> Often the object is in a different grammatical case than the subject, in some languages also for the nouns and not only pronouns.
